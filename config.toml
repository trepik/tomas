My stray shoes took me overseas to learn Spanish and sutdy data analysis at the **University of Tennessee Chattanooga**. After a year abroad I came back to Brno to complete my master studies. During my entire studies I always freshened my mind on hikes with scouts. I also found a job in Brno at **Red Hat** where I started doing open source. After completing my studies and becoming a **Master of Bioinformatics** I moved back to Bratislava. In september 2017 I joined **Instarea** a big data monetization company, where I'm working as Software engineer."
